1 Python Flask Extension Parts
------------------------------

coaches.py
++++++++++

* Import part of the coaches.py file

     .. code-block:: python

      from flask import request
      from flask import render_template
      from config import app
      from config import create_connection, close_connection
      import psycopg2
      import teams
      from store import StoreTeam

render_template and request features of Flask web framework have used.
app object of Flask has imported from config.
team class and StoreTeam class has imported. Since "corrent_team" attribure refers to teams table
pyscopg2 has imported as a dbapi2 for use as a database api.

* route function of coaches for rendering teams.html file

     .. code-block:: python

      @app.route("/coaches/", methods=['GET', 'POST'])
      def coaches():
      dsn = app.config['dsn']

      app.store = StoreTeam(dsn)
      all_teams = app.store.getAllTeams(dsn)

      if request.method == 'GET':
        all_coaches = join_tables()

This part of coaches function renders the url '/teams' with coaches.html file. Uses 'GET' and 'POST' methods.
Uses dsn as a database settings which is implementing in config.py whether ElephantSQL or
Vagrant database system. To get all teams for joint tables first getAllTeams function used and teams assigned to all_teams variable.
after that join_tables function used to join teams and coaches tables to get meaningful data and assigned to all_coaches variable.


* delete method

     .. code-block:: python

      elif 'delete' in request.form:
        ids = request.form.getlist('coaches_to_delete')
        for id in ids:
            delete_coach(id)

        all_coaches = join_tables()


If request method is delete which means if delete button has clicked on html page. Code requests checked box information and assign this to a list called ids.
Then each element in ids list sent to delete_coach function which deletes tuple from table. Then all_coaches variable renewed with remaining tuples.

* add method

     .. code-block:: python

      elif 'add' in request.form:
        # ----------------------------------------------
        name = request.form['name']
        gender = request.form['gender']
        nationality = request.form['nationality']
        birth_date = request.form['birth_date']
        current_team = request.form['current_team']
        # ----------------------------------------------

        add_new_coach(name, gender, nationality, birth_date, current_team) # save to db

        all_coaches = join_tables()

If request method is add which means add button has clicked on html page. Code requests the values entered in textboxes.
These values sent to add_new_coach function which adds the tuple with according values to the table. New all tuples fetched to print to the screen

* update method

     .. code-block:: python

      elif 'update' in request.form:
        ids = request.form.getlist('update')
        for id in ids:
            name_update = request.form['name_update'+id]
            gender_update = request.form['gender_update'+id]
            nationality_update = request.form['nationality_update'+id]
            birth_date_update = request.form['birth_date_update'+id]
            current_team_update = request.form['current_team_update'+id]

            update_coach(id,name_update,gender_update,nationality_update,birth_date_update,current_team_update)

        all_coaches = join_tables()

If request method is update which means if update button clicked on html page. Code requests the values entered in textboxes and
gets the ids with checkedboxes. for each id tuples changed with new values. New all tuples fetched to print to the screen.

* find method

     .. code-block:: python

      elif 'find' in request.form:
        para_1 = request.form['name_find']
        para_2 = request.form['gender_find']
        para_3 = request.form['nationality_find']
        para_4 = request.form['birth_date_find']
        para_5 = request.form['current_team_find']

        all_coaches = find_coach(para_1,para_2,para_3,para_4,para_5)


Else if request method is find which means find button clicked on html page. Code requests the values from textboxes for attributes.
values sent to find_coach function to select according tuples from table and print.

* showall method

     .. code-block:: python

      elif 'showall' in request.form:

        all_coaches = join_tables()

Else if request method is showall which means Show All button has clicked on html page. Coaches table and teams table joint to
show all coaches tables tuples with according curent_team value.

     .. code-block:: python

      return render_template("coaches.html", coaches=all_coaches, teams_select=all_teams)

Route function returns render_template function which gets all coaches and send them to html page to print to the screen.
